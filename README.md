# Library-Management-Project-Using-Python

# About the project:

There is a login id-password in loop which ends after three wrong id-passwords entered. Login is for both students and the librarian. Students can see which of the books are available for them, they can search book with subject name, author name, and unique book_id. Students can also issue books and return them. Librarian can change id - password of themselves. Librarian can also see book details, add and delete books, can add and remove student. Librarian can check which books are issued by the students.
